    """Decorator to wrap API views to use a previously cached response. Otherwise, calculate and save on the way out.

    Notes:
        This custom decorator is implemented so that
        we can cache `POST` endpoints as well as `GET` endpoints.
        Typically, we wouldn't want to cache `POST` endpoints.
        Our `charts`, `tables` and `downloads` endpoints are all `POST` endpoints.
        In reality, the only reason for them to be `POST` endpoints is down
        to the request payload.
        For all intents and purposes, they behave like `GET` endpoints.
        Hence, the decision was made to create this custom decorator to cache them.
        Since, the out-of-the-box cache decorators do not implement the ability
        to cache `POST` endpoints.

    Args:
        timeout: The number of seconds after which the response is expired
            and evicted from the cache.
            If set to `0` the response will not be cached at all.
            If set to `None`, the response will be indefinitely cached,
            until the cache is flushed intentionally.
        is_reserved_namespace: Boolean switch to store the data
            in the reserved / long-lived namespace within the cache.
            Defaults to `False`.

    Returns:
        The response containing the results of the request.
        Note that the results could be retrieved from the cache
        or calculated from the server
