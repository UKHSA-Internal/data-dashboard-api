         Notes:
             Page url parts are returned as a tuple of
                (site_id, site_root_url, page_url_relative_to_site_root)
            The base implementation of this method assumes Wagtail
            is running in full app mode i.e not in headless,
            because the building of page paths is handed off to
            the `wagtail-serve` route which does not exist in headless mode.
            Hence, the need to override and provide the url here.

        Args:
            `request`: Optional request object which is not to
                be used for our implementation.

        Returns:
            Tuple containing the URL parts:
                1) ID of the corresponding `Site` record
                2) The root URL of the site
                    e.g. `https://ukhsa-dashboard.data.gov.uk`
                3) The path of the current page.
                    This always returns an empty string
                    e.g. `""`
                    This is because the landing page is assumed
                    to be at the root of the visible page tree.
