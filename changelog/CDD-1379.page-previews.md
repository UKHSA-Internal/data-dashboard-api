# CDD-1379 - Page Previews

Jira: https://ukhsa.atlassian.net/browse/CDD-1379?search_id=055fe61d-bee9-48d9-80bc-ffb0f1c26b76&referrer=quick-find

## Summary

Allow editors of headless composite pages to click a **Preview** button that immediately redirects them to the external frontend application, rather than opening the built-in Wagtail iframe preview.  Preview URLs include a short-lived signed token so the frontend can safely fetch draft content from the CMS.

## Implementation details

**Preview Button**

**CompositePage.is_previewable**
   * Previously returned `False` (comment/documentation mismatch); tests and
     runtime behaviour also assumed preview wasn’t available.  Set back to
     `True` so Wagtail renders preview-related UI.

**Admin hooks & redirect view**
   * Added `PreviewToFrontendRedirectView` in `cms/dashboard/views.py`.
     - builds a payload (slug, editor id, iat, exp)
     - signs with `django.core.signing.dumps(..., salt="preview-token")`
     - redirects to a configurable frontend URL containing the signed token
   * Registered the view under `cms_preview_to_frontend` via
     `register_admin_urls` hook.
   * Wagtail hook `register_page_header_buttons` returns a `Button` that
     points at the admin redirect URL (with fallback) when `view_name ==
     "edit"`.
   * Added `construct_page_action_menu` hook inserting a custom
     `ActionMenuItem` as the primary action, ensuring the preview button is
     visible in the page editor header.

**Suppressing the preview panel**
   * Monkey-patched `EditView.get_side_panels` at import time in
     `cms/dashboard/wagtail_hooks.py`.
   * Patch filters out any `PreviewSidePanel` instance when the page being
     edited is a `CompositePage` (or subclass), preventing the iframe panel
     from being constructed.
   * Added comprehensive unit tests verifying the patch behaviour without
     hitting the database.

**Tests**
   * Added a comprehensive suite of unit tests covering every change:
     - `frontend_preview_button` returns a `Button` in edit mode and falls
       back to the template URL when reverse fails.
     - Redirect view permissions, success path, and URL tokenization logic.
     - `add_frontend_preview_action` handles missing/PK-less pages, reverse
       failures, and even exceptions during menu insertion.
     - Monkey‑patched `EditView.get_side_panels` strips the preview panel and
       gracefully handles errors during filtering.
     - `_add_page_to_parent` behaviour tested, including raising
       `ValueError` when passed `None`.
   * Tests are written to avoid any database access where possible by using
     fakes and sentinels; only a single integration test touches the DB.
   * The two modified modules (`wagtail_hooks.py` and
     `build_cms_site_helpers/pages.py`) are fully exercised by the new tests.

**Documentation & comments**
   * Added explanatory comments throughout hooks file explaining rationale
     and behaviour.
   * Adjusted `CompositePage.is_previewable` docstring to explain why it's
     `True` now and how the panel is suppressed separately.

**Why**

The service is headless; embedding the CMS iframe preview is inappropriate and results in missing-template errors.  Editors still need a convenient way to view draft pages in context, so we intercept the preview flow, keep the preview button, and redirect to the external Next.js application with an
HMAC token.  This approach preserves Wagtail’s preview plumbing (e.g. the `is_previewable` flag and button hooks) while avoiding the iframe and making preview links easy to secure and consume.

## Handling Preview Requests

**Preview API**
   * Implemented token verification directly in the existing drafts endpoint
     (`/api/drafts/{id}/`) in `cms/dashboard/viewsets.py`.
     - Expects a Bearer token in the `Authorization` header.
     - Verifies the token using the application-configured salt and TTL.
     - Verifies `page_id` in token payload matches the `{id}` path parameter.
     - Returns HTTP 401 for missing, invalid or expired tokens.
   * Removed the separate `pages/preview/<slug>` endpoint.

**Why a separate serializer is needed**
  * The draft endpoint is implemented via a Wagtail API ViewSet and serializes unpublished revisions.
  * `CMSDraftPagesSerializer` keeps preview output stable while adapting Wagtail serializer expectations for draft payloads.

**Gotchas and how we handle them**
   * **Unmapped relational fields** (e.g. `latest_revision`) can trigger
     `KeyError: serializer_class`.
     - **Handling**: fallback to read-only `PrimaryKeyRelatedField` for
       relations without child serializer mappings.
   * **Context-dependent Wagtail fields** can expect ViewSet internals and fail with errors like missing `seen_types`/`base_queryset`.
     - **Handling**: rely on ViewSet serializer context and avoid problematic fields in the draft serializer output.
   * **Nested page relation fields** (`parent`, `alias_of`) can recursively invoke Wagtail serializer paths that require full router/viewset state.
     - **Handling**: remove those fields (and other context-heavy meta fields such as `type`/`detail_url`) from the preview serializer output.
   * **Static serializer vs dynamic Wagtail serializer assumptions** can drift.
     - **Handling**: explicitly define serializer attributes used by Wagtail internals and cover these branches with dedicated unit tests.

**Why**
  * **Reuse existing drafts endpoint**: Implementing token validation directly on `/api/drafts/{id}/` keeps one canonical draft read path while adding preview-specific auth checks.
   * **Headers vs querystrings**: Bearer tokens in `Authorization` headers are preferred over querystring parameters because querystrings are more likely to be captured in logs, analytics, and intermediary infrastructure. Using headers reduces accidental token exposure and aligns with standard API authentication practices.  Note that for ease of implementation, these headers are implemented only on the CMS API, and not on the preview button, where querystrings are used.  It is possible that we would improve the Preview button in a future version.
   * **Why serializer-level fixes were needed**: the crashes happened in Wagtail/DRF field construction, not in URL routing or token checks.  Addressing serializer integration was the durable fix.
